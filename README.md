# Home_Sales
module 22

Using SparkSQL, I examined home sales data by using SparkSQL to create temporary views, partition the data, and cache and uncache a temporary table.

4 questions analyzed:
1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?
2. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?
3. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?
4. What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000?
